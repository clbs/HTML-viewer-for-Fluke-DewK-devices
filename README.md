# HTML-viewer-for-Fluke-DewK-devices
Uses the RHT.INI file created for met/team, met cal and met/track to generate a webpage to view the temperatures remotely from one station
Python generates the HTML. This script can be ran in a service with custom refresh intervals. 

Tabular would be a better solution for generating the table, however I'm unable to install modules on the computer I'm running this code on due to network permissions.
